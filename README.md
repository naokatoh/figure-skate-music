# Analysis on music preference of men's figure skating medalits


**Why music?**  
- Figure skaters chooses a couple of songs they skate to during each season. 
- They use the songs throughout the season, the music they choose reflects their preference. 
- Figure skating is not only about jumps and spin. Musical interpretation is also one of the elements evaluated by the judges. 
- Until the 2014-2015 season, single and pair figure skaters were not allowed to skate to music with words.
- Now skaters can select from a wide range of music!
- At the Beijing Olympics, music selected by men's single figure skaters were particularly ecletic! (Daft Punk, Aarosmith, Santana...etc)

## What I did with which skill
- Python (BeautifulSoup, Selenium, pandas) :for data analysis
- datawrapper :for data viz
- I analyzed three medalists, Nathan Chen, Yuma Kagiyama and Shoma Uno
- I scraped Wikipedia pages of each skaters and made song lists that they used in each season.

- **Thing that I tried and feel satisfied**: Successfully scraped a Wikipedia page's table with ease😊 Datawrapper skills and data biz😊
- **Thing that I struggled with** : Scraping the href and find music genres from a Wilipedia page. So many songs's pages are not even exsit, so I ended up seach music genres of many, many songs manually...
- **Thing that I tried but couldn't complete**: There were so many music data missing! It seems like there used to be a database for figure skating music (http://www.skatemusiclist.com/) but it's gone. So I could have tried women's single skating music, but didn't have enough time for it.
