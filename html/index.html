            <h4>vvvvvvvvv</h4>
            <p>Figure skating is not only about jumps and spinning. Music is an indispensable component for great performance and higher scores. 


            </p>
            
            <p>“In my mind, I can see musical notes on ice. While doing the choreography, I skate on the notes.” Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, a two-time Olympic champion said in a 2015’s interview.

            <p>In fact, while the judging panel carefully grade technical element by each skater, they also evaluate music interpretation as one of the five program component scores. As skaters usually play the same programs (short program, free skating, and exhibition) throughout each season, meaning they need to select at least two songs and skate to them throughout the season. The right choice of music is definitely significant for every skater. 

                
            </p>Traditionally, there are staple figure skating songs. From Giacomo Puccini’s Turandot to Maurice Ravel’s Boléro, classical music has been a regular favorite for skaters. 


            <p>However, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/09/sports/olympics/playlist-mens-free-skate.html">singles and pairs skaters have been permitted to compete to music with lyrics</a> from the 2014-2015 season, the music on ice has been diversified.  The Beijing Olympics is no exception. 
                
            </p>

            <p>The programs in men’s figure skating at this year’s Olympics were particularly eclectic. Adam Siao Him Fa of France skated to the mashup songs of Daft Punk, Donovan Carrillo of Mexico chose “Black Magic Woman” by the Latin rock band Santana, which was formed by Mexican American guitarist Carlos Santana. Hanyu, who ended the fourth place, skated to the classical “Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso” by Camille Saint-Saëns in his short program, but this classical masterpiece he skated to was edited and played by a professional pianist exclusively for his performance.

            <p>Three medalists at the Beijing Olympics, Nathan Chen of the US, Yuma Kagiyama, and Shoma Uno of Japan also skated to music from very different genres. In the free skating program, Chen performed energetically with Elton John’s hit songs, while Kagiyama showed perfect skating on the instrumental film score from “Gladiator,” and Uno chose the classic Boléro to win his Olympic medals in a row.

            Music taste can change over time. However, from the list of songs they skated to so far, it turns out that their choice of music is clearly diverse. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As there is few figure skating music database available online, I scraped a program table of each skater in Wikipedia and made individual music lists for their short program and free skating. If a song has its own Wikipedia page, I also scraped it and extracted each primary music genre. If not, I estimated a song’s genre based on the musician or composer. 
                To categorize each music genre, I roughly separated them into three categories, classical, experimental, and popular music. For analytical purposes, some music sub-genres are combined. For example, electro-pop and trance music was categorized under electronic music. 
                   
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: I excluded their exhibition program from the analysis. The exhibition program is not for competition, rather for showcasing skaters’ best selves under no pressure so the songs played in the exhibition gala tend to be popular songs or other lift-me-up types of music. (Chen selected Avicii’s “The Nights” for this season’s exhibition, for example) 
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is the music genre proportion  by Chen, Kagiyama, and Uno in the past ten seasons:
  
            </p>

            <iframe title="Nathan Chen's recent favorite is non-classical music" aria-label="Stacked Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-nDZkP" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nDZkP/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="500"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
            </script>

            <p>
            Apparently, Chen used to choose classical music for his program but gradually shift to pop/ rock songs. For this season, he chose some classical music (Mozart’s “Piano Concerto No. 23” and “Lacrimosa ”) but at the Beijing Olympics, he only selected “La Bohème” by a Chanson maestro Charles Aznavour for his short program, and mashup songs of Elton John’s “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,” “Rocket Man,” and “Bennie and the Jets” for his free skating. All the songs that he won his first Olympics gold medal were not instrumental.  
 
            </p> 

            <iframe title="Rising star Yuma Kagiyama adores music in films" aria-label="Stacked Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-MxXLy" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MxXLy/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="500"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
            </script>

            <p>
                A rising star Kagiyama’s favorite is not classical music, either. But he loves film scores, such as the instrumental soundtrack from “Avator” and “ The Lord of the Rings” ( 2020-2021 season).  One of the two classical music songs he skated to is a piece of ballet music “The Firebird” by Igor Stravinsky. The song is the same song that Kagiyama’s father Masakazu, who was a former figure skater and two-time Olympian.  
            </p>

            <iframe title="Shoma Uno constantly goes for classical music" aria-label="Stacked Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-c2wgd" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/c2wgd/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="500"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
            </script>
            <p>
               On the other hand, Uno’s choice of music definitely falls into classical scores but he also likes to challenge new realms. In Beijing, he skated to “Oboe Concerto” by the Venetian classical composer Alessandro Marcello for his short program. With Bolero for his free skating, he only selected classical music for the Olympics. However, he also adores skating to electronic music, which is not so popular among other skaters. In the 2020-2021 and 2019-2020 seasons, he skated to “Great Spirit” by Dutch DJ, Armin van Buuren, and an Israeli psytrance duo Vini Vici, which apparently never been used by any figure skater so far. 
 
            </p>
           
             
            <p>
                Just by looking at the top three men's figure skaters of today, you'll discover that ice music is highly diversified. Skating is a competition anyway, so you might wonder what music genre can represent the best performance of a skater.   
            </p>

            <p>
                "You hear this music every single day, " Chen said in the interview with USA TODAY. "So if something that is not fun to skate, it becomes kind of a chore for a period of time."
